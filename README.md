- "Budget App"
- This is an app designed for mobile that helps users track their budgets. You can input a budget amount, and then track how much of your budget you have left depending on your itemized expenses you also put into the app as well. It utilizes local storage to keep the information even after leaving the page and coming back. I threw in additional functionality to handle multiple deposits, and a reset button so that users can reset local storage and start from scratch. I intended to inject a table of itemized expenses so that users could view their budget in a ledger style, but ran out of time due to having my interview-test in the morning.
